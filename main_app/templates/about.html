  <b>Motivation:</b> <br> <br>
  The idea for LingoLab came from my struggle to remember all the cool new words I encounter every day. Rather than jotting them down on random scraps of paper (or just forgetting them entirely), I decided to build an app that keeps them all in one placeâ€”so now my words are as organized as I hope my life will be... someday. ðŸ˜‰
